Installing Django 3.2 on Windows

Prerequisites:

Windows operating system

Administrator privileges

Steps:


Download and Install Python:

Visit the official Python downloads page: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the latest stable version of Python (3.x.x recommended).

During installation, ensure you check the option to "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (or similar wording).

Verify Python Installation:

Open a command prompt window (search for "cmd" in the Start menu).

Type python --version and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version displayed.

Create a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):

Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects on your system.

Open a command prompt window.

Use the venv module (introduced in Python 3.3):

python -m venv my_django_env  # Replace 'my_django_env' with your desired name

For older Python versions (<= 3.2), use virtualenv:

pip install virtualenv  # If you don't have pip yet, refer to step 4a

virtualenv my_django_env

Activate the Virtual Environment:


Windows Command Prompt:

my_django_env\Scripts\activate  # Replace 'my_django_env' with your environment name

PowerShell:

PowerShell

.\my_django_env\Scripts\Activate  # Replace 'my_django_env' with your environment name

Use code with caution.

You'll see the virtual environment name prepended to your command prompt, indicating activation.

Install pip (if not already present):

If pip isn't found in step 2, install it using get-pip.py:

python get-pip.py

Install Django 3.2:

Inside your activated virtual environment, run:

pip install django==3.2

Type django-admin --version and press Enter. You should see "3.2" or the exact version installed.
